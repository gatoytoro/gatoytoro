Hi! 

My name is Marcos and I am currently looking for a new position in software development. 
I graduated with a BSE in Electrical Engineering from Mercer University in 2016, 
and since then I rose up the ranks of UPS as a Facilities Engineer; being an engineer's manager was my last position there. 

In college, I used C++ and Mathematica extensively to create beautiful programs, 
and in my job, I learned a great deal of HMI, PLC, and ladder logic programming. 
I have a programmer's mindset, and now I am looking to start a new adventure on the software development side of things. 

I am presently learning to use python, SQL, data analytics, and solidity to solve problems in the real-world.

One thing my employers have always discovered very early is that I learn quickly!

Looking forward to speaking with you soon.

                    --Marcos
